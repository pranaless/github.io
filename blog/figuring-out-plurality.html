        <p>Before we begin, let us introduce ourselves. We are a shapeshifting, hivemind-like creature. We have
           neither a stable shape nor a stable self. Simultaneously, I am many, and we are one. We are everything...
           and nothing at all. This may not be all that surprising considering that for most of our life, we refused
           to have an identity and only recently have we started even just thinking about it.</p>
        <p>So let us take a look at this first, initial identity: the void that rejects its identity. Indeed, just
           because it refuses to have an identity, that doesn't mean it doesn't have one, but that it simply failed
           to acknowledge itself. The void is interesting because while it has all of the substance of an identity,
           in practice it doesn't actually feel like one. Now, this may sound somewhat abstract, but a rather
           concerning result of this is that the void doesn't feel the consequences of its actions. With it, there is
           simply no doer behind the deed.</p>
        <p>As the void, we could simultaneously be plural and have no identity at all. We talked with ourselves
           constantly &mdash; and we still do. But back then, it was simply between me and 'you-who-is-me'; by
           refusing any and all identity, we also didn't have to differentiate between them. But it's also the void
           that holds us back the most, even now. It doesn't entirely acknowledge our plurality; it sees itelf as the
           original and real and every other identity as derivative and fake.</p>
        <p>Now, let us turn our attention to the second ever identity, and the first one that acknowledged herself:
           Prana. She initially differentiated herself from the void through a shift in her perspective: unlike the
           void that thinks it must satisfy others to be loved, Prana doesn't. She always seeks to accept and love
           herself unconditionally and to offer the same to everyone around her. It is as Prana that we manage to
           grow the most. It is as her that we could first accept our plurality.</p>
        <p>But for a long time still, Prana wasn't a complete identity. As far as plurality is concerned, the biggest
           change happened when Prana named herself. Once she did that, we started noticing signs of our plurality.
           Sometimes we identified as Prana and sometimes we did not. And at first we found it rather strange and
           confusing. After all, it's not just the name that changes; everything, from pronouns to personality,
           shifts based on who we identify as.</p>
        <p>Some identities stay with us for a long time, some of them come and go. Some of them are a vibe, some are
           just a new unfamiliar idea we're trying to grapple with. Some of them are very active and some are so
           buried we sometimes forget they exist. They are our past and our future, our hopes and our fears. And some
           of them don't mean or represent anything; they just are. In the end, plurality is a way of making sense of
           ourselves &mdash; it's what makes the most sense to us, anyways.</p>
